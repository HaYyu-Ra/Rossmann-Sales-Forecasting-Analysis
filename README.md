Rossman Sales Analysis
Project Overview

The Rossman Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing and forecasting sales for Rossman, a large retail chain. This project aims to predict sales for various stores across multiple regions, taking into account a range of factors such as promotions, holidays, competition, and store-specific details. The goal is to improve business decision-making through accurate sales predictions.
Project Goals

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand customer purchasing behavior, identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.
    Sales Forecasting: Develop predictive models to forecast future sales at different stores.
    Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset with additional features (e.g., promotions, holidays) to improve model performance.
    Modeling: Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or LSTM models) for sales forecasting.

Key Steps

    Data Collection: Gather raw data on store sales, promotions, and other influencing factors.
    Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Analyze sales trends over time.
        Explore the impact of promotions and holidays.
        Analyze customer behavior across stores.
    Feature Engineering: Create additional features to improve model accuracy (e.g., month, day of the week, store types).
    Model Training: Train machine learning models using historical sales data and engineered features.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
    Prediction: Forecast future sales based on the trained models.

Data Sources

The dataset used in this project includes:

    Historical sales data for Rossman stores.
    Additional data such as promotions, holidays, store-specific information, etc.

Technologies and Libraries

This project leverages the following tools and libraries:

    Python: The primary language for data analysis and machine learning.
    Jupyter Notebooks: Used for data exploration, visualization, and model building.
    Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
    Scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
    TensorFlow/Keras: (Optional) For deep learning models (e.g., LSTM).
    Git: Version control.
    GitHub: Repository for collaboration and code storage.
